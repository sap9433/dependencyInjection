# Dependency Injection
A lightweight java plugin to inject dependency . Useful, if your project is not a spring boot project , and you still want to leverage the power of DI without adding the full fled-get spring-core jar . 

## Possible uses

We were working on a Spark application using java . we wanted to leverage dependency injection . Noticed there is no stand alone jar for that ,
Only way was to ass spring jars to our dependency . Which we didn't want . So wrote this stand alone jar.
